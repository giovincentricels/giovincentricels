## Hi there 👋, my name is Giovincent Ricel's Tanoto


## 😄 All about me
✨Database Enthusiast | ⚡Python & SQL Explorer | Badminton & Gaming Enjoyer<br><br>
Hey! I'm a huge fan of exploring Python, MySQL, and occasionally drowning in AI/R/Kafka—currently based in Alam Sutera. When I'm not battling NULL values, you'll find me smashing shuttlecocks 🏸, throwing ranked games in Mobile Legends 🎮 (my WR is questionable), or chilling with WoW Classic. "SELECT sleep FROM life" still returns no rows, but hey—at least my queries (mostly) work! 😄
